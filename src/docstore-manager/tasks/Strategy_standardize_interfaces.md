# Task: Standardize Interfaces
**Parent:** `implementation_plan_code_quality.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
Analyze similar components across the codebase and define consistent interfaces with aligned method signatures, parameter names, and return types to improve code maintainability and reduce cognitive load for developers.

## Context
The docstore-manager project has similar components for both Qdrant and Solr implementations, such as clients, commands, and formatters. However, these components may have inconsistent interfaces, making it difficult for developers to work with both implementations. Standardizing these interfaces will improve code maintainability and make it easier for developers to understand and extend the codebase.

## Steps
1. Identify similar components across the codebase
   - Client interfaces (Qdrant vs. Solr)
   - Command interfaces
   - Formatter interfaces
   - Configuration interfaces
   - Utility functions

2. Analyze the current interfaces
   - Document the method signatures, parameter names, and return types for each component
   - Identify inconsistencies between similar components
   - Note any implementation-specific requirements that may affect standardization

3. Define standard interfaces for client classes
   - Identify common operations across Qdrant and Solr clients
   - Define standard method signatures with consistent parameter names
   - Ensure return types are consistent or compatible
   - Document the standard interface

4. Define standard interfaces for command classes
   - Identify common operations across Qdrant and Solr commands
   - Define standard method signatures with consistent parameter names
   - Ensure return types are consistent or compatible
   - Document the standard interface

5. Define standard interfaces for formatter classes
   - Identify common formatting operations
   - Define standard method signatures with consistent parameter names
   - Ensure return types are consistent or compatible
   - Document the standard interface

6. Update the Qdrant implementation to match the standard interfaces
   - Refactor the QdrantClient class to match the standard client interface
   - Refactor the Qdrant command classes to match the standard command interfaces
   - Refactor the QdrantFormatter class to match the standard formatter interface
   - Ensure backward compatibility or provide migration guidance

7. Update the Solr implementation to match the standard interfaces
   - Refactor the SolrClient class to match the standard client interface
   - Refactor the Solr command classes to match the standard command interfaces
   - Refactor the SolrFormatter class to match the standard formatter interface
   - Ensure backward compatibility or provide migration guidance

8. Update the core module to support the standard interfaces
   - Refactor the base classes to define the standard interfaces
   - Update any utility functions to work with the standard interfaces
   - Ensure backward compatibility or provide migration guidance

9. Update tests to reflect the standardized interfaces
   - Update test cases to use the standard interfaces
   - Add tests to verify that the interfaces are implemented correctly
   - Ensure all tests pass with the standardized interfaces

10. Update documentation to reflect the standardized interfaces
    - Update docstrings to reflect the standard interfaces
    - Document the standard interfaces in the README or developer documentation
    - Provide examples of how to use the standard interfaces

## Dependencies
- Requires: None
- Blocks: None

## Expected Output
1. Standard interfaces defined for client, command, and formatter classes
2. Updated implementations of Qdrant and Solr components to match the standard interfaces
3. Updated core module to support the standard interfaces
4. Updated tests to verify the standardized interfaces
5. Updated documentation to reflect the standardized interfaces
