# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core CLI Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main CLI entry point with argument parsing and command structure that will be used across all backends.
# Details:
Use argparse to implement the CLI structure with subcommands for different operations. Include global flags like --profile for selecting configuration profiles. Implement the main command groups (create, delete, list, info, get, batch) with placeholders for backend-specific implementations. Set up the command routing based on selected backend from configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test the CLI argument parsing with various command combinations. Verify that the correct backend handlers are called based on configuration.
