# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive test suite covering all functionality with >85% coverage.
# Details:
Implement unit tests for all components and integration tests for command workflows. Use mocking for external services (Qdrant, Solr). Set up test fixtures and helpers for common testing scenarios. Implement test coverage reporting to ensure >85% coverage. Include tests for error conditions and edge cases.

# Test Strategy:
Run the test suite with coverage reporting. Verify that all major functionality is covered. Test with mock backends to avoid external dependencies. Include tests for configuration handling, command parsing, and backend-specific operations.
