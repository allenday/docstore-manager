**Parent:** `implementation_plan_release_prep.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
Create a comprehensive release checklist that includes pre-release checks, release steps, and post-release steps to ensure a successful release of the docstore-manager project to PyPI.

## Context
The docstore-manager project is preparing for its 0.1.0 release to PyPI. A systematic release process is essential for ensuring that the release is successful and that all necessary steps are completed. This task involves creating a comprehensive release checklist that will guide the release process and help prevent common issues.

## Steps
1. Research best practices for Python package releases
   - Review PyPI documentation on package releases
   - Review GitHub documentation on releases
   - Identify common issues and how to prevent them

2. Create a RELEASE.md file
   - Include an introduction explaining the purpose of the document
   - Structure the document into pre-release, release, and post-release sections
   - Use clear, step-by-step instructions
   - Include commands where appropriate

3. Define pre-release checks
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Verify documentation is complete and up-to-date
   - Verify code quality standards are met
   - Verify version number is updated in all relevant files
   - Verify CHANGELOG.md is updated with the new version
   - Verify all dependencies are correctly specified
   - Verify package builds successfully
   - Verify package installs successfully
   - Verify CLI command works correctly

4. Define release steps
   - Create a git tag for the release
   - Push the tag to GitHub
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Build the package
   - Upload the package to PyPI
   - Verify the package is available on PyPI

5. Define post-release steps
   - Verify installation from PyPI
   - Announce the release
   - Update documentation with installation instructions
   - Plan next development cycle
   - Update version number for development

6. Create a release checklist template
   - Create a template that can be used for each release
   - Include checkboxes for each step
   - Include space for notes and issues

7. Test the checklist
   - Review the checklist for completeness
   - Verify that all steps are clear and actionable
   - Identify any missing steps or ambiguities

8. Finalize the checklist
   - Address any issues identified during testing
   - Format the document for readability
   - Add any additional information or resources

## Dependencies
- Requires: None
- Blocks: None

## Expected Output
1. A comprehensive RELEASE.md file with detailed instructions for the release process
2. A release checklist template that can be used for each release
3. Clear, actionable steps for pre-release, release, and post-release activities

5. Upload the package to PyPI
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

6. Verify the package is available on PyPI
   - Go to https://pypi.org/project/docstore-manager/

## Post-Release Steps

After the release is complete, follow these steps:
