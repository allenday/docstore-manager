# Task: Apply DRY Principles
**Parent:** `implementation_plan_code_quality.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
Identify duplicated code patterns across the codebase and extract them into shared utility functions or base classes to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability.

## Context
The docstore-manager project has similar implementations for both Qdrant and Solr, which may lead to code duplication. Applying the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by extracting common patterns into shared utilities will reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and make the codebase more consistent. This is an important step in preparing for the 0.1.0 release to PyPI.

## Steps
1. Identify duplicated code patterns
   - Use tools like pylint's duplicate-code checker to identify duplicated code blocks
   - Perform manual code review to identify similar patterns that may not be exact duplicates
   - Focus on the following areas:
     - Error handling patterns
     - Configuration loading and validation
     - Command execution patterns
     - Formatting patterns
     - CLI argument parsing

2. Analyze error handling patterns
   - Identify common error handling patterns across Qdrant and Solr implementations
   - Extract common error handling logic into shared utility functions
   - Create base exception classes for common error types
   - Ensure consistent error messages and logging

3. Analyze configuration loading and validation
   - Identify common configuration loading and validation patterns
   - Extract common configuration logic into shared utility functions
   - Create base configuration classes for common configuration types
   - Ensure consistent configuration validation and error handling

4. Analyze command execution patterns
   - Identify common command execution patterns across Qdrant and Solr implementations
   - Extract common command execution logic into shared utility functions or base classes
   - Create a command execution framework that can be used by both Qdrant and Solr
   - Ensure consistent command execution and error handling

5. Analyze formatting patterns
   - Identify common formatting patterns across Qdrant and Solr implementations
   - Extract common formatting logic into shared utility functions or base classes
   - Create a formatting framework that can be used by both Qdrant and Solr
   - Ensure consistent formatting and error handling

6. Analyze CLI argument parsing
   - Identify common CLI argument parsing patterns
   - Extract common CLI argument parsing logic into shared utility functions
   - Create a CLI argument parsing framework that can be used by both Qdrant and Solr
   - Ensure consistent CLI argument parsing and error handling

7. Implement shared utility functions
   - Create a utilities module for shared functions
   - Implement utility functions for common operations
   - Ensure utility functions are well-documented and tested
   - Update existing code to use the new utility functions

8. Implement base classes
   - Create base classes for common components (clients, commands, formatters)
   - Implement common functionality in the base classes
   - Ensure base classes are well-documented and tested
   - Update existing classes to inherit from the base classes

9. Update tests
   - Create tests for the new utility functions and base classes
   - Update existing tests to reflect the changes
   - Ensure all tests pass with the new implementation

10. Update documentation
    - Document the new utility functions and base classes
    - Update existing documentation to reflect the changes
    - Provide examples of how to use the new utility functions and base classes

## Dependencies
- Requires: None
- Blocks: None

## Expected Output
1. A set of shared utility functions for common operations
2. Base classes for common components
3. Updated implementation that uses the shared utilities and base classes
4. Tests for the new utility functions and base classes
5. Updated documentation

Example of a shared utility function:
```python
def validate_collection_name(collection_name: str) -> None:
    """Validate a collection name.

    Args:
        collection_name: The name of the collection to validate.

    Raises:
        InvalidInputError: If the collection name is invalid.
    """
    if not collection_name:
        raise InvalidInputError("Collection name cannot be empty.")
    if not isinstance(collection_name, str):
        raise InvalidInputError(f"Collection name must be a string, got {type(collection_name).__name__}.")
    if len(collection_name) > 255:
        raise InvalidInputError(f"Collection name cannot exceed 255 characters, got {len(collection_name)}.")
    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', collection_name):
        raise InvalidInputError(f"Collection name can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, got '{collection_name}'.")
```

Example of a base class:
```python
class BaseCommand:
    """Base class for commands."""

    def __init__(self, client: Any, logger: logging.Logger = None):
        """Initialize the command.

        Args:

            logger: The logger to use for logging. If None, a default logger will be created.
        """
        self.client = client
        self.logger = logger or logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def execute(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Execute the command.

            **kwargs: Keyword arguments for the command.

        Returns:
            The result of the command execution.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: If the command is not implemented.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("Command execution not implemented.")

    def validate_args(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        """Validate the command arguments.

            **kwargs: Keyword arguments for the command.

        Raises:
            InvalidInputError: If the arguments are invalid.
            NotImplementedError: If the validation is not implemented.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("Argument validation not implemented.")

    def handle_error(self, error: Exception, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        """Handle an error that occurred during command execution.

        Args:
            error: The error that occurred.
            *args: Positional arguments for the command.
            **kwargs: Keyword arguments for the command.

        """
        self.logger.error(f"Error executing command: {error}", exc_info=True)
        raise error

        Raises:

        try:

            # Execute the command using the client
            result = self.client.create_collection(collection_name, **kwargs)
