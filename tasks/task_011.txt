# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the batch command for performing bulk operations on Solr documents.
# Details:
Implement the 'batch' command for Solr that supports:
- Adding new fields/values to documents
- Deleting specific fields from documents
- Replacing existing fields/values in documents
- Operating on documents matching specific IDs or queries

Ensure efficient batching of operations to minimize API calls.
