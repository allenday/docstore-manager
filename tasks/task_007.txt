# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Qdrant Batch Command
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the batch command for performing bulk operations on Qdrant documents.
# Details:
Implement the 'batch' command for Qdrant that supports:
- Adding new fields/values to documents
- Deleting specific fields from documents using JSON path selectors
- Replacing existing fields/values in documents
- Operating on documents matching specific IDs (provided directly or via file) or filters

Ensure efficient batching of operations to minimize API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test batch operations with various input formats (direct IDs, file input, filters). Verify correct application of field additions, deletions, and replacements. Test with large batches to ensure performance.
