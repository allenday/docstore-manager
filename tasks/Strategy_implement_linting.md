# Task: Implement Linting
**Parent:** `implementation_plan_code_quality.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
Set up linting and formatting tools (flake8, pylint, black) and configure them in pyproject.toml to enforce code quality standards. Add pre-commit hooks to ensure consistent code quality across the project.

## Context
The docstore-manager project currently lacks standardized linting and formatting configuration. Implementing these tools will help enforce coding standards, catch potential bugs, and ensure consistent code style across the project. This is an important step in preparing for the 0.1.0 release to PyPI, as it will improve code quality and maintainability.

## Steps
1. Analyze the current codebase
   - Identify the Python version used in the project
   - Understand the current code style and patterns
   - Note any existing linting or formatting configuration

2. Set up flake8 configuration
   - Install flake8 if not already installed
   - Create or update pyproject.toml with flake8 configuration
   - Configure appropriate rules and exclusions
   - Test flake8 on a sample file to verify configuration

3. Set up pylint configuration
   - Install pylint if not already installed
   - Create or update pyproject.toml with pylint configuration
   - Configure appropriate rules and exclusions
   - Test pylint on a sample file to verify configuration

4. Set up black configuration
   - Install black if not already installed
   - Create or update pyproject.toml with black configuration
   - Configure line length and other formatting options
   - Test black on a sample file to verify configuration

5. Add pre-commit hooks
   - Install pre-commit if not already installed
   - Create .pre-commit-config.yaml file
   - Configure hooks for flake8, pylint, and black
   - Add additional hooks as needed (e.g., isort for import sorting)
   - Test pre-commit hooks to verify configuration

6. Apply formatting to the entire codebase
   - Run black on all Python files
   - Fix any formatting issues
   - Commit the formatting changes

7. Run linting on the entire codebase
   - Run flake8 and pylint on all Python files
   - Document any issues that need to be addressed
   - Create a plan for addressing these issues

8. Update documentation
   - Add information about linting and formatting to the README
   - Include instructions for contributors on how to use the linting tools
   - Document any project-specific coding standards

## Dependencies
- Requires: None
- Blocks: None

## Expected Output
1. Updated pyproject.toml with configurations for flake8, pylint, and black
2. .pre-commit-config.yaml file with hooks for linting and formatting
3. Formatted codebase that adheres to the configured standards
4. Documentation on linting and formatting in the README
5. A list of any remaining linting issues that need to be addressed

Example pyproject.toml configuration:
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py38']
include = '\.pyi?$'
exclude = '''
/(
    \.git
  | \.hg
  | \.mypy_cache
  | \.tox
  | \.venv
  | _build
  | buck-out
  | build
  | dist
)/
'''

[tool.flake8]
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore = "E203"
exclude = [
    ".git",
    "__pycache__",
    "build",
    "dist",
]

[tool.pylint.messages_control]
disable = [
    "C0111",  # missing-docstring
    "C0103",  # invalid-name
    "C0330",  # bad-continuation
    "C0326",  # bad-whitespace
    "W0511",  # fixme
    "W1202",  # logging-format-interpolation
    "R0913",  # too-many-arguments
    "R0914",  # too-many-locals
]

[tool.pylint.format]
max-line-length = 88
```
