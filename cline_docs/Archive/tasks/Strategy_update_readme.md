Update the README to accurately reflect the project's current name (docstore-manager) and purpose, including both Qdrant and Solr functionality.

## Context
The current README is focused on "Qdrant Manager" and only mentions Qdrant functionality. The project has been renamed to "docstore-manager" and now includes support for both Qdrant and Solr.

4. Update the Configuration section
   - Add Solr configuration examples alongside Qdrant examples
   - Update the configuration file paths to use "docstore-manager" instead of "qdrant-manager"
   - Explain how to configure both Qdrant and Solr connections
   - Update the profile examples to include both Qdrant and Solr profiles

5. Update the Testing section
   - Ensure the testing instructions apply to both Qdrant and Solr
   - Update any Qdrant-specific testing instructions to include Solr equivalents

6. Update the Usage section
   - Add Solr commands alongside Qdrant commands
   - Update the command descriptions to apply to both Qdrant and Solr
   - Add examples for Solr usage
   - Update the connection options to include Solr-specific options

7. Update the Examples section
   - Add examples for Solr operations
   - Ensure existing examples use "docstore-manager" instead of "qdrant-manager"
   - Provide a balanced set of examples for both Qdrant and Solr

8. Update the Changelog section
   - Add an entry for the rename and Solr support
   - Ensure the version numbers are correct

9. Review the entire README for consistency
   - Ensure all references to "Qdrant Manager" have been changed to "docstore-manager"

   - Check for any remaining Qdrant-specific language that should be generalized

## Dependencies
- Requires: None
- Blocks: None

## Expected Output
A comprehensive README that:
1. Accurately reflects the project's current name (docstore-manager)
2. Describes the project's purpose and capabilities for both Qdrant and Solr
3. Provides clear installation, configuration, and usage instructions for both Qdrant and Solr
