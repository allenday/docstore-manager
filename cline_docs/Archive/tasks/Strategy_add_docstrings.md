# Task: Add Docstrings to Public APIs
**Parent:** `implementation_plan_documentation.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
Add comprehensive docstrings to all public APIs following the Google docstring format to improve code readability and facilitate better understanding of the codebase.

## Context
The docstore-manager project has many public APIs across its core, Qdrant, and Solr modules. These APIs need comprehensive docstrings to help users and developers understand how to use them correctly. The Google docstring format has been chosen for its readability and wide adoption in the Python community.

## Steps
1. Identify all public APIs in the codebase
   - Core module
     - client/ classes and methods
     - command/ classes and methods
     - config/ classes and methods
     - exceptions/ classes
     - format/ classes and methods
   - Qdrant module
     - cli.py functions
     - client.py classes and methods
     - command.py classes and methods
     - config.py classes and methods
     - format.py classes and methods
     - utils.py functions
   - Solr module
     - cli.py functions
     - client.py classes and methods
     - command.py classes and methods
     - config.py classes and methods
     - format.py classes and methods
     - utils.py functions

2. Learn the Google docstring format
   - Understand the structure of Google docstrings
   - Familiarize yourself with the sections (Args, Returns, Raises, Examples)
   - Review examples of well-documented Python code using Google docstrings

3. Add docstrings to the Core module
   - Add class-level docstrings to all classes
   - Add method-level docstrings to all public methods
   - Include Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples sections as appropriate
   - Ensure consistency in formatting and terminology

4. Add docstrings to the Qdrant module
   - Add function-level docstrings to all CLI functions
   - Add class-level docstrings to all classes
   - Add method-level docstrings to all public methods
   - Include Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples sections as appropriate
   - Ensure consistency with Core module docstrings

5. Add docstrings to the Solr module
   - Add function-level docstrings to all CLI functions
   - Add class-level docstrings to all classes
   - Add method-level docstrings to all public methods
   - Include Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples sections as appropriate
   - Ensure consistency with Core and Qdrant module docstrings

6. Review and refine all docstrings
   - Check for consistency in formatting and terminology
   - Ensure all parameters are documented
   - Verify that return values are clearly described
   - Confirm that exceptions are properly documented
   - Add examples where they would be most helpful

## Dependencies
- Requires: None
- Blocks: None

## Expected Output
All public APIs in the docstore-manager project will have comprehensive docstrings following the Google format, including:
1. Class-level docstrings for all classes
2. Method-level docstrings for all public methods
3. Function-level docstrings for all public functions
4. Consistent formatting and terminology throughout
5. Appropriate sections (Args, Returns, Raises, Examples) for each docstring

Example of a good Google-style docstring:
```python
def get_documents(client, collection_name, doc_ids=None, with_payload=True, with_vectors=False):
    """Retrieve documents by ID from a document store collection.

    Args:
        client: Initialized client for the document store.
        collection_name: Name of the collection to retrieve documents from.
        doc_ids: List of document IDs to retrieve. If None, no documents will be retrieved.
        with_payload: Whether to include document payload in the results. Defaults to True.
        with_vectors: Whether to include document vectors in the results. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        None: The function logs the retrieved documents but does not return them.

    Raises:
        InvalidInputError: If invalid or empty document IDs are provided.
        CollectionDoesNotExistError: If the specified collection does not exist.
        DocumentError: If an error occurs during document retrieval.

    Examples:
        >>> client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)
        >>> get_documents(client, "my_collection", ["doc1", "doc2"])
        # Output will be logged, not returned
    """
