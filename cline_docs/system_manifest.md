# System: Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT)

## Purpose
A framework for managing complex tasks via recursive decomposition and persistent state tracking across distinct operational phases.

## Architecture
```
[Set-up/Maintenance] --> [Strategy] --> [Execution] --> [Cleanup/Consolidation]

## Module Registry
- [src]: Core implementation of the CRCT system
- [cline_utils/dependency_system]: Dependency tracking and analysis tools
- [cline_docs]: System memory and documentation
- [docs]: Project documentation

## Development Workflow
1. Set-up/Maintenance: Initialize and verify system state
2. Strategy: Plan and decompose tasks based on dependencies
3. Execution: Implement tasks following instructions
4. Cleanup/Consolidation: Organize results and update documentation
5. Loop back to Set-up/Maintenance or Strategy as needed
