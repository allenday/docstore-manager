# Changelog

## 2025-05-03
- **Improved Project Traceability**: Removed tasks/ directory from .gitignore to enable task file tracking for better traceability. Added all task files to version control to maintain a history of tasks and their completion status.

- **Completed Strategy_fix_collectionconfig_validation task**: Verified that the mock_client_fixture function in tests/qdrant/test_qdrant_cli.py already correctly creates a valid CollectionConfig object. The function already creates a CollectionParams object with the VectorParams, and includes the required hnsw_config and optimizer_config fields. The remaining test failures in tests/qdrant/test_qdrant_cli.py are related to CLI command issues, not CollectionConfig validation.

- **Updated Git Workflow Practices**: Added git workflow practices to the [LEARNING_JOURNAL] in .clinerules, including always using `--no-gpg-sign` flag when committing, creating task-specific branches for each execution work cycle, and properly merging and pushing changes to maintain organized version control. Created a `dev` branch for development work and clarified that `release-0.1.0` should be reserved for actual releases.

- **Completed Strategy_fix_parameter_validation task**: Fixed the CollectionConfig validation errors in test_qdrant_cli.py by properly creating CollectionParams, HnswConfig, and OptimizersConfig objects with all required fields. Updated the mock_client_fixture function to use the correct classes and include all required parameters. The test_get_documents_success test now passes successfully.

- **Completed Strategy_fix_cli_testing_context task**: Resolved the RuntimeError in CLI tests by refactoring all tests in tests/qdrant/test_qdrant_cli.py to use Click's CliRunner instead of directly calling callback functions. This ensures proper setup of the Click context during testing. Renamed duplicate test functions and updated assertions to check exit codes and output messages. The test_cli_client_load_failure test now passes successfully.

- **Completed Strategy_fix_collection_info_formatting task**: Fixed the TypeError in the format_collection_info method of QdrantFormatter class by modifying the _clean_dict_recursive method to always return a dictionary when handling non-serializable types. Updated the method to wrap string representations in a dictionary with "value" and "original_type" keys instead of returning a string directly. All tests in tests/qdrant/test_format.py now pass successfully.

- **Transitioned to Execution phase**: Updated .clinerules and activeContext.md to reflect the transition to the Execution phase. Started working on the first test fix task: Fix Collection Info Formatting.

    - `Strategy_prepare_pypi_package.md`: Task for configuring setuptools in pyproject.toml and testing the build process.
    - `Strategy_create_release_checklist.md`: Task for creating a comprehensive release checklist.
- **Created Implementation Plans**: Created four implementation plans for the docstore-manager 0.1.0 release:
  - `implementation_plan_test_fixes.md`: Plan for fixing test failures and errors, including collection info formatting, CLI testing context, parameter validation, and CollectionConfig validation.
  - `implementation_plan_documentation.md`: Plan for documentation improvements, including README updates, docstring additions, and usage examples.
  - `implementation_plan_code_quality.md`: Plan for code quality enhancements, including linting implementation, complexity reduction, interface standardization, and DRY application.
  - `implementation_plan_release_prep.md`: Plan for release preparation, including version updates, PyPI package preparation, and release checklist creation.
- **Updated docstore-manager_module.md**: Added comprehensive module documentation to the docstore-manager_module.md file, including purpose, interfaces, implementation details, current status, and implementation plans. Preserved the existing mini-tracker content.
- **Created HDTA Review Progress Tracker**: Created hdta_review_progress_20250503.md to track the review and update status of HDTA documentation during the Strategy phase.
- **Created Hierarchical Task Checklist**: Created hierarchical_task_checklist_20250503.md to provide a hierarchical overview of all modules, implementation plans, and tasks for the docstore-manager 0.1.0 release.
- **Transitioned to Strategy phase for docstore-manager 0.1.0 release**: Updated .clinerules and activeContext.md to reflect the transition to the Strategy phase. Defined the goal of creating a comprehensive plan for the docstore-manager 0.1.0 release to PyPI, covering test failures, documentation improvements, and code quality concerns.

- **Fixed failing tests in docstore-manager project**: Fixed two failing tests in the docstore-manager project:
  - `test_get_documents_success` in `test_qdrant_command.py`: Changed the default value of `with_vectors` parameter from `True` to `False` in the `get_documents` function and modified the function to pass the parameter value to both the `client.retrieve` method and the `formatter.format_documents` method.
  - `test_cli_client_load_failure` in `test_qdrant_cli.py`: Updated the test to use the Click `CliRunner` instead of calling the callback directly and modified the test to check for the correct error message.
- **Identified failing tests in docstore-manager project**: Ran pytest in the src/docstore-manager/.venv environment and documented 4 failing tests and 16 errors, primarily related to validation errors in CollectionConfig and formatting issues.
- **Created system_manifest.md**: Initialized the system manifest with basic project structure and purpose.
- **Created progress.md**: Added high-level project checklist for tracking progress across all phases.
- **Updated activeContext.md**: Replaced placeholder content with current project focus and next steps.
- **Updated .clinerules**: Updated LAST_ACTION_STATE to reflect current progress.
- **Generated tracker files**: Used analyze-project to generate module_relationship_tracker.md and doc_tracker.md.
- **Verified dependencies**: Confirmed no placeholders in tracker files.
- **Completed Set-up/Maintenance phase**: Updated all files to reflect completion of the phase.

*Note: Set-up/Maintenance phase completed. Ready for transition to Strategy phase.*
