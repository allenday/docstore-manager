# Active Context

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the CRCT system. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and alignment.

## Current Work Focus:

- Transitioned to Execution phase for documentation improvements
- Beginning implementation of documentation improvements based on the comprehensive plan
- Starting with MkDocs integration to establish a solid documentation foundation
- Will follow with API reference generation, README improvements, and user/developer guides
- Previous Strategy phase accomplishments:
  - Created detailed plans and task instructions for making documentation immaculate
  - Developed comprehensive implementation plan for documentation improvements
  - Created task instructions for MkDocs integration, API reference generation, README improvements, and user/developer guides
- Previous accomplishments:
  - Successfully published docstore-manager 0.1.0 to PyPI
  - Completed all test fixes (Collection Info Formatting, CLI Testing Context, Parameter Validation, CollectionConfig Validation)
  - Implemented initial documentation improvements (README updates, API docstrings, usage examples)
  - Prepared and published the PyPI package

## Next Steps:

1. Implement MkDocs integration:
   - ✅ Install MkDocs and required plugins
   - ✅ Configure MkDocs with Material theme
   - ✅ Set up documentation structure
   - Configure automatic deployment
3. Generate API reference documentation using mkdocstrings
4. Improve README structure for better clarity and organization
5. Create comprehensive user guide and developer guide

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- The docstore-manager project provides full lifecycle management of document store databases (Solr and Qdrant)
- Target users are SRE and developers in information retrieval, data analytics, and AI sectors
- All tests now pass successfully:
  - Regular tests: 373 passed, 6 skipped
  - Integration tests: 2 passed
- Initial documentation improvements completed:
  - README has been updated to reflect "docstore-manager" instead of "Qdrant Manager"
  - Docstrings have been added to all public APIs in the Qdrant module
  - Comprehensive usage examples created for both Qdrant and Solr interfaces
  - CHANGELOG.md created to track version history
- Package published to PyPI:
  - Version 0.1.0 is now available on PyPI
  - Can be installed with `pip install docstore-manager`
  - Package includes both wheel and source distribution formats
- Some placeholders ('p', 's', 'S') still exist in docstore-manager_module.md and module_relationship_tracker.md
- Git workflow practices established:
  - Always use `--no-gpg-sign` flag when committing
  - Create a task-specific branch at the beginning of each execution work cycle
  - Commit and push changes to the task branch
  - Merge back to the development branch (dev)
  - Push the development branch to origin
  - Reserve the release-0.1.0 branch for actual releases, not for development work
- Task files are now tracked in version control for better traceability
- New focus on making documentation immaculate and integrating mkdocs for better organization
