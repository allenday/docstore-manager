## Current Work Focus:

- Completed all documentation improvement tasks for the docstore-manager project
- Successfully published docstore-manager 0.1.0 to PyPI
- Completed all test fixes
- Implemented comprehensive documentation improvements:
  - Integrated MkDocs with Material theme
  - Generated API reference documentation using mkdocstrings
  - Improved README structure for better clarity and organization
  - Created comprehensive user guide
  - Created comprehensive developer guide
  - Added usage examples for both Qdrant and Solr interfaces
  - Added docstrings to all public APIs
- Reorganized changelog by component for better readability
- Completed Cleanup/Consolidation phase:
  - Organized results by reorganizing changelog by component
  - Updated documentation by updating progress.md to reflect completed phases
  - Cleaned up temporary files by archiving completed task files and temporary session files

## Next Steps:

1. Transition to Set-up/Maintenance phase for verification or Strategy phase for next planning cycle

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- The docstore-manager project provides full lifecycle management of document store databases (Solr and Qdrant)
- Target users are SRE and developers in information retrieval, data analytics, and AI sectors
- All tests now pass successfully:
  - Regular tests: 373 passed, 6 skipped
  - Integration tests: 2 passed
- Documentation improvements completed:
  - MkDocs with Material theme has been integrated
  - API reference documentation has been generated using mkdocstrings
  - README structure has been improved for better clarity and organization
  - User guide has been created with comprehensive information on installation, configuration, and usage
  - Developer guide has been created with architecture overview, contributing guidelines, development setup, and extension points
  - Examples have been added to enhance understanding
  - Documentation site is accessible through GitHub Pages
- Package published to PyPI:
  - Version 0.1.0 is now available on PyPI
  - Can be installed with `pip install docstore-manager`
  - Package includes both wheel and source distribution formats
- Some placeholders ('p', 's', 'S') still exist in docstore-manager_module.md and module_relationship_tracker.md
- Git workflow practices established:
  - Always use `--no-gpg-sign` flag when committing
  - Create a task-specific branch at the beginning of each execution work cycle
  - Commit and push changes to the task branch
  - Merge back to the development branch (dev)
  - Push the development branch to origin
  - Reserve the release-0.1.0 branch for actual releases, not for development work
- Task files are now tracked in version control for better traceability
- Changelog has been reorganized by component (Documentation, Testing, Release, Project Management) for better readability
- Completed task files and temporary session files have been archived for better organization
