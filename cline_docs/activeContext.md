# Active Context

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the CRCT system. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and alignment.

## Current Work Focus:

- Executing tasks for the docstore-manager 0.1.0 release to PyPI
- Completed the first test fix task: Fix Collection Info Formatting
  - Fixed the TypeError in the format_collection_info method of QdrantFormatter class
  - Modified the _clean_dict_recursive method to always return a dictionary when handling non-serializable types
  - All tests in tests/qdrant/test_format.py now pass successfully
- Completed the second test fix task: Fix CLI Testing Context
  - Resolved the RuntimeError in CLI tests by using Click's CliRunner
  - Refactored all tests to use CliRunner instead of directly calling callback functions
  - Verified the fix by running the failing test, which now passes successfully
- Completed the third test fix task: Fix Parameter Validation
  - Fixed the CollectionConfig validation errors in test_qdrant_cli.py
  - Properly created CollectionParams, HnswConfig, and OptimizersConfig objects with all required fields
  - Verified the fix by running the failing test, which now passes successfully
- Completed the fourth test fix task: Fix CollectionConfig Validation
  - Verified that the mock_client_fixture function in tests/qdrant/test_qdrant_cli.py already correctly creates a valid CollectionConfig object
  - The function already creates a CollectionParams object with the VectorParams, and includes the required hnsw_config and optimizer_config fields
  - The remaining test failures in tests/qdrant/test_qdrant_cli.py are related to CLI command issues, not CollectionConfig validation
- Moving on to documentation improvements:
  - Update README
  - Add Docstrings to Public APIs
  - Create Usage Examples

## Next Steps:

1. Begin documentation improvements:
   - Update README to accurately reflect the project's current name and purpose
   - Add comprehensive docstrings to all public APIs
   - Create usage examples for both Qdrant and Solr interfaces
2. Continue with code quality enhancements:
   - Implement Linting
   - Reduce Cyclomatic Complexity
   - Standardize Interfaces
   - Apply DRY Principles
3. Prepare for release:
   - Update Version Number
   - Prepare PyPI Package
   - Create Release Checklist

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- The docstore-manager project provides full lifecycle management of document store databases (Solr and Qdrant)
- Target users are SRE and developers in information retrieval, data analytics, and AI sectors
- Key failing tests identified:
  - Collection info formatting issues (`TypeError: 'str' object is not a mapping`)
  - CLI testing context problems (`RuntimeError: There is no active click context`)
  - Parameter validation in the get_documents function
  - CollectionConfig validation errors (16 errors in `test_qdrant_cli.py`)
- Documentation needs significant improvement:
  - README currently refers to "Qdrant Manager" instead of "docstore-manager"
  - Docstrings need to be added/improved for all public APIs
  - Usage examples needed for both Qdrant and Solr
- Some placeholders ('p', 's', 'S') still exist in docstore-manager_module.md and module_relationship_tracker.md
- Git workflow practices established:
  - Always use `--no-gpg-sign` flag when committing
  - Create a task-specific branch at the beginning of each execution work cycle
  - Commit and push changes to the task branch
  - Merge back to the development branch (dev)
  - Push the development branch to origin
  - Reserve the release-0.1.0 branch for actual releases, not for development work
