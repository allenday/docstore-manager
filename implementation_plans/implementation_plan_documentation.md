# Implementation Plan: Documentation Improvements

## Scope
This implementation plan addresses the documentation needs for the docstore-manager project in preparation for the 0.1.0 release to PyPI. The plan focuses on three key areas: updating the README to accurately reflect the project's current name and purpose, adding comprehensive docstrings to all public APIs, and creating usage examples for both Qdrant and Solr interfaces. Proper documentation is essential for user adoption, as it helps users understand how to use the tool effectively and reduces the learning curve.

## Design Decisions
- **README Structure**: The README will follow a standard structure including introduction, installation, configuration, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. It will be updated to refer to "docstore-manager" instead of "Qdrant Manager" throughout.
- **Docstring Format**: We will use the Google docstring format for all Python code, which is widely recognized and provides good readability. This format includes sections for Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples.
- **Usage Examples**: We will create separate usage examples for Qdrant and Solr, covering all major operations (list, create, delete, info, add-documents, remove-documents, get, search). Examples will be provided in both the README and as standalone example scripts.
- **Documentation Consistency**: We will ensure consistent terminology and formatting across all documentation to provide a cohesive user experience.

## Algorithms
- **README Update**: The README update process will involve a systematic review and replacement of "Qdrant Manager" references with "docstore-manager", as well as expanding sections to cover both Qdrant and Solr functionality.
  - Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of lines in the README
- **Docstring Addition**: The docstring addition process will involve identifying all public APIs and adding comprehensive docstrings following the Google format.
  - Complexity: O(m) where m is the number of public APIs
- **Usage Example Creation**: The usage example creation process will involve developing examples for all major operations for both Qdrant and Solr.
  - Complexity: O(p) where p is the number of operations to document
